Welcome to **DeepSleep**! üåô‚ú®

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli). The project is named **DeepSleep** and is designed for sleep tracking. üõåüí§

# Getting Started üöÄ

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

### Using Yarn
```bash
yarn start
```
### To use another port
```bash
npx react-native start --port 8082
```

## Step 2: Start your Application üì±

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

### For Android
```bash
yarn android
```

### For iOS
```bash
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Building your Application üõ†Ô∏è

To build your application for Android and iOS, you can use the following commands:

### For Android
```bash
yarn build:android --build-cache
```
Or
```bash
yarn build:android --parallel
```

### For iOS
```bash
yarn build:ios --build-cache
```
Or
```bash
yarn build:ios --parallel
```

## Step 4: Installing the Application üì≤

To install the app quickly, you can use the following commands:

### For Android
```bash
yarn install:android
```

### For iOS
```bash
yarn install:ios
```

## Step 5: Cleaning the Application üßπ

To clean the app, use the following commands:

### For Android
```bash
yarn clean:android
```

### For iOS
```bash
yarn clean:ios
```

## Step 6: Modifying your App ‚úèÔ∏è

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!
